Description: ==========
        ical2org
        ==========
        
        ical2org is a command line tool for exporting data from the Mac OS X
        application iCal so it can be used with the emacs tool `org-mode`_.
        Data transfer is one-way only (from iCal to emacs), and is intended to
        be used to show alarms and scheduled events managed by iCal within
        org's agenda view.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use normal Python application steps to install ical2org::
        
        $ pip install ical2org
        
        or::
        
        $ easy_install ical2org
        
        The source distribution is created using `Distribute`_, which will be
        installed with ical2org.  The other dependencies (`pytz`_ and
        `vobject`_) will also be installed automatically.
        
        Generating org-mode Files
        =========================
        
        While ical2org supports multiple output formats, the default is an
        org-mode outline.  Each calendar entry includes the summary, location,
        date and time, and complete description (useful for searching).
        
        For example, to extract the entries from a calendar called "Meetup:
        Python", you would run::
        
        $ ical2org "Meetup: Python"
        Starting 14 days ago at 2010-01-03 00:00:00-05:00
        Ending 30 days from now at 2010-02-17 00:00:00-05:00

        Output is encoded as UTF-8, which may not work with Unix pipes and
        shell redirection.  To save the output to a file instead of having it
        printed to standard output, use the ``-o`` option.
        
        By default, ical2org processes all of the calendars which are
        displayed in iCal.  Hidden calendars are ignored unless you give their
        name on the command line.
        
        Generating Diary Files
        ======================
        
        The default output format uses org's outline structure.  If you would
        rather use emacs' diary-mode, use ``-f diary`` to switch modes.  The
        diary entries do not include the full text of the event.
        
        Recommended Use
        ===============
        
        The recommended way to use ical2org is to export your iCal data at
        least every day.  That gives you a moving window of fresh data, since
        the date range for export is limited.  Save the output to a file
        (e.g., ``~/Documents/Notes/calendar.org``) and add the file to org's
        list of inputs for building agenda views.
        
        If you use org-mode for taking notes in meetings, refile each event as
        you make notes to avoid overwriting it the next time your calendars
        are exported.
        
        For example, you might run a command like::
        
        $ ical2org -o ~/Documents/Notes/calendar.org -b 30 -e 30
        
        to export the data starting 30 days ago and ending 30 days from today
        to the file ``calendar.org``.
        
        Recurring Events
        ================
        
        Recurring events in iCal are "exploded" to create separate entries in
        the output.  This makes it easy to refile an event when you add notes,
        without having the notes from one meeting occurance appear on the
        wrong date.
        
        Command Line Options
